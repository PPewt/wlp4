# WLP4 Tools

WLP4 is a toy programming language developed for use in CS241 at the University
of Waterloo. Over time I've written a number of tools for it, including
emulators for the machine code it compiles to, compilers for students to use
as references, etc. These largely can't be released since they could be used
as assignment solutions. However, I've also accumulated various silly code
snippets which are included here.

The files with .c extensions are actually wlp4 code, but the .c extension is
used for syntax highlighting.
